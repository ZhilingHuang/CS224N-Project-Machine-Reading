\"conciliation committee\" is convened, representing meps, ministers and the commission to try and get agreement on a joint text: if this works, it will be sent back to the parliament and council to approve by absolute and qualified majority. this means, legislation can be blocked by a majority in parliament, a minority in the council, and a majority in the commission: it is harder to change eu law than stay the same. a different procedure exists for budgets. for \"enhanced cooperation\" among a sub-set of at least member states, authorisation must be given by the council. member state

planet earth is what fixes the constancy of the length of a day and the length of a year. albert einstein extended the principle of inertia further when he explained that reference frames subject to constant acceleration, such as those free-falling toward a gravitating object, were physically equivalent to inertial reference frames. this is why, for example, astronauts experience weightlessness when in free-fall orbit around the earth, and why newton's laws of motion are more easily discernible in such environments. if an astronaut places an object with mass in mid-air next to himself, it will remain stationary with respect to the astronaut due to its inertia. this is the same thing that would occur if the astronaut and the object were in intergalactic space with no net force of gravity acting on their shared reference frame. this principle of equivalence was one of the foundational underpinnings for the development of the general theory of relativity",

circumstances, the locals accepted the call of emperor alexius i comnenus to join forces with the byzantines against the normans. the albanian forces could not take part in the ensuing battle because it had started before their arrival. immediately before the battle, the venetian fleet had secured a victory in the coast surrounding the city. forced to retreat, alexius ceded the command to a high albanian official named comiscortes in the service of byzantium. the city's garrison resisted until february 1082, when dyrrachium was betrayed to the normans by the venetian and amalfitan merchants who had settled there. the normans were now free to penetrate into the hinterland; they took ioannina and some minor cities in southwestern macedonia and thessaly before appearing at the gates of

selkabssyrelsen the court of justice found that a uk limited company operating in denmark could not be required to comply with denmark's minimum share capital rules. uk law only required £1 of capital to start a company, while denmark's legislature took the view companies should only be started up if they had 200,000 danish krone ( around €27,000) to protect creditors if the company failed and went insolvent. the court of justice held that denmark's minimum capital law infringed centros ltd's freedom of establishment and could not be justified, because a company in the uk could admittedly provide services in denmark without being established there, and there were less restrictive means of achieving the aim of creditor protection. this approach was criticised as potentially opening the
